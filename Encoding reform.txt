This describes necessary adjustments to the encoding to keep it free from mess.

New encoding will be described at the end of this file and will replace the original encoding when the font is completed.

Below is the list of changes and the rationale if needed.

The information is on the reform is incomplete. I finished moving and readjusting the blocks before I finished compiling this, what was thought to be the plan for the adjustment. If you need the complete information, open the fonts and see.

## Primary Characters

Range: U+E000~U+E05F, same as original
Order: same as original, the order should be same for Primary and Secondary Case characters to simplify input code assignment.

## Secondary Case Characters

Range: U+E060~U+E0BF, same as original
Order: same as original, see above.
Glyphs: Glyphs should be rebuilt based on a system of references to several elementary unencoded glyphs.

## Laterally Reversed Secondary Case Characters

Range: U+E0C0~U+E11F, inserted after Secondary Case Characters and should be considered to be in the same block.
Order: same as original.

## Tertiary Characters

Range: U+E120~U+E126
Order: same as original.

## Consonantal Characters

Range: U+E127~U+E152
Order: should be changed based on the form of the glyphs so that horizontally flipped forms (as a block) follow basic forms, therefore, p p’ v w m t t’ ţ l k k’ x h ň q q’ c č c’ č’ s š r / b pʰ v y n d tʰ dh ļ g kʰ xh ’ tļ ř qʰ ż j cʰ čʰ z ž ç

## Vertically Inverted Consonantal Characters
Range: U+E153~U+E17E [Moved by +80]
Order: should be changed to follow consonantal characters.

Order: same as original

## Bottom Character Extensions
Range: U+E1A8~U+E1C8, moved after Consonantal Top Extensions.
Order: First the Primary extensions in Affiliation/Extension order, then Consonantal extensions in the order of appearance. Both types of diacritics are mostly visually similar and attached to bottom of the character.

## Diacritics
Range: U+E1C8~U+E1EF
Order: First top, then middle, then bottom diacritics. The order is by pairs.

## Secondary Aspect/Modality Characters
Range: U+E1F0~U+E24D
