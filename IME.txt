New untitled Javascript IME for Ithkuil
===

I created a new Javascript IME for Ithkuil that works in a browser, it’s easy to do and works on many platforms (Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari tested).

## How to use

The instructions are given in the IME main file itself, `input.html` (Currently it is renamed `index.html` for convenience).

IME requires the following files to work:

* jquery-3.1.0.min.js — JQuery library
* input.js — IME main logic
* input_codes.js — input code definitions
* style.css — stylesheet for Ithkuil texts

These files are planned to be included but not ready yet:

* modifiers.js — a script to replace the character+modifiers combinations (that can be input with IME) with a single character, in order to show characters with modifiers correctly
* boustrophedonise.js — a script that reverses text every second line of Ithkuil text and ads the little triangle mark to show Ithkuil text in its intended writing direction.

## Input Codes

input_codes.js might me converted to JSON in future or alternative implementations.

The IME relies on a slightly different input code convention than the precious version, as it only utilises alphabet key for the input.

It is supposed that no single input code should be assigned to more than 9 variants because there is no paging of the variants.

It is also supposed that whenever a category has 9 variants, which is often the case with Ithkuil, e.g. Configuration, 3 Patterns × 3 Stems, or Suffix Degrees, the variants should correspond to the natural numbering (e.g. the user can type DEG7 to get a diacritic for Suffix Degree 7). Therefore, there’s often a placeholder in place where no symbol has to be added.

## Stylesheet

Stylesheet makes the Oltartkhica font available for the browser (most modern browsers support embedded OpenType fonts) and provides several styles:

* #input_matches is styled to show red characters with black stroke just like in several places on the Grammar website (does not show in Firefox for some reason)

* For Ithkuil text *[lang="ith"] selector is used, therefore you should just set ‘lang’ attribute of any html element with Ithkuil text to "ith" to show it in Oltratkhica. This also means Ithkuil 

Aultartkʰiupš — The Old Ithkuil Input Method
===

The input method is a table in .cin format that can be used to type Ithkuil using Oltartkica font.

## How to install

### OS X
Copy aultartkhiups.cin file to ~/Library/Input Methods folder. Open ‘Input Sources’ in Keyboard Preferences and add it to your input methods. Alternatively, install OpenVanilla and add the .cin file there.

### Other systems
Use SCIM or other input method that supports .cin tables.

## How to type

Primary and Secondary characters are input with their abbreviation (used in the Grammar), e.g. Primary Case Character 32 CLA may be input with either ‘cla’ or ‘csm’. Placeholder characters, namely, Secondary (and Consonantal) Placeholder Characters are input with ‘nc’ (for ‘no case’ or ‘no consonant’).

Tertiary characters are input with ‘ter’.

Modifiers and diacritics to Primary and Secondary characters are input with the abbreviations of their categories. For example, the diacritics for Nomic perspective are input with ‘n’, and the diacritics for Formal Designation with ‘fml’. It is possible to input diacritics (or modifers) specifically by putting a ‘/’ between the categories, i.e. the diacritic for Nomic perspective _and_ Formal Designation may be input with ‘n/fml’ or ‘fml/n’.

Pattern, Stem and Relation modifiers (which should immediately follow the Consonantal character in order for ligatures to display properly) are input with the Relation abbreviation, either ‘unf’ or ‘fra’.

Intensive Bias modifiers&diacritics are shown by adding ‘,’ to the abbreviation, e.g. ‘ctp,’, ‘asu,’, etc.

Other diacritics are also input with their abbreviations, with a few exceptions. Personal reference adjunct diacritic can be input with ‘pr’, and suffix degree diacritics with ‘deg’.

Consonantal characters are input by their transliteration with the following adjustments:

* Ejective consonants are shown with ‘'’, e.g. ‘b'’, ‘p'’, etc.; Glottal stop is ‘'’;
* Aspirative consonants are shown with ‘h’;
* Ţ, dh, xh, ļ, ç, and ż are shown with ‘,’ after the letter, e.g. ‘l,’, ‘z,’, etc; tļ is input with ‘tl’;
* Letters with a hacek (ň, č, ř, ž) are shown with ‘,’ before the letter, e.g. ‘,n’, ‘,c’, etc; E.g. ‘čʰ’ is input with ‘,ch’;
* As noted earlier, placeholder consonants (for consonant cobinations that cannot be expressed with single character, and for bias) are input with ‘nc’.

Prefixes and suffixes are input in rather unintuitive way. First of all, they are always input after the root letter, even the prefixes (see the rules for ligatures in the main font file). Secondly, a slash ‘/’ is added in the place of the root letter. E.g. prefix q+C is input with ‘q/’ and suffix C+ř is input with ‘/,r’. Gemination is input with ‘//’

Punctuation (quote and transliteration symbols) are input with ‘/’.
