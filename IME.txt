Aultartkʰiupš — Ithkuil Input Method
===

The input method is a table in .cin format that can be used to type Ithkuil using Oltartkica font.

## How to install

### OS X
Copy aultartkhiups.cin file to ~/Library/Input Methods folder. Open ‘Input Sources’ in Keyboard Preferences and add it to your input methods. Alternatively, install OpenVanilla and add the .cin file there.

### Other systems
Use SCIM or other input method that supports .cin tables.

## How to type

Primary and Secondary characters are input with their abbreviation (used in the Grammar), e.g. Primary Case Character 32 CLA may be input with either ‘cla’ or ‘csm’. Placeholder characters, namely, Secondary (and Consonantal) Placeholder Characters are input with ‘nc’ (for ‘no case’ or ‘no consonant’).

Tertiary characters are input with ‘ter’.

Modifiers and diacritics to Primary and Secondary characters are input with the abbreviations of their categories. For example, the diacritics for Nomic perspective are input with ‘n’, and the diacritics for Formal Designation with ‘fml’. It is possible to input diacritics (or modifers) specifically by putting a ‘/’ between the categories, i.e. the diacritic for Nomic perspective _and_ Formal Designation may be input with ‘n/fml’ or ‘fml/n’.

Pattern, Stem and Relation modifiers (which should immediately follow the Consonantal character in order for ligatures to display properly) are input with the Relation abbreviation, either ‘unf’ or ‘fra’.

Intensive Bias modifiers&diacritics are shown by adding ‘,’ to the abbreviation, e.g. ‘ctp,’, ‘asu,’, etc.

Other diacritics are also input with their abbreviations, with a few exceptions. Personal reference adjunct diacritic can be input with ‘pr’, and suffix degree diacritics with ‘deg’.

Consonantal characters are input by their transliteration with the following adjustments:

* Ejective consonants are shown with ‘'’, e.g. ‘b'’, ‘p'’, etc.; Glottal stop is ‘'’;
* Aspirative consonants are shown with ‘h’;
* Ţ, dh, xh, ļ, ç, and ż are shown with ‘,’ after the letter, e.g. ‘l,’, ‘z,’, etc; tļ is input with ‘tl’;
* Letters with a hacek (ň, č, ř, ž) are shown with ‘,’ before the letter, e.g. ‘,n’, ‘,c’, etc; E.g. ‘čʰ’ is input with ‘,ch’;
* As noted earlier, placeholder consonants (for consonant cobinations that cannot be expressed with single character, and for bias) are input with ‘nc’.

Prefixes and suffixes are input in rather unintuitive way. First of all, they are always input after the root letter, even the prefixes (see the rules for ligatures in the main font file). Secondly, a slash ‘/’ is added in the place of the root letter. E.g. prefix q+C is input with ‘q/’ and suffix C+ř is input with ‘/,r’. Gemination is input with ‘//’

Punctuation (quote and transliteration symbols) are input with ‘/’.
